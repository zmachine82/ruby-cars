step 1:
   define a simple method and call it

   def say_hello
    puts "Hello World"
   end

   say_hello

step 2:
    delete hello world
    puts a welcome message of some kind --customize

Challenge: 
    Context: We are making a simple Car Inventory System for a small used car dealer. Our first request is to add a simple way to add new inventory into the system as it comes in.

    Objective: create a basic intake form for a car, after collecting the data display it in a single puts statment in a sensible way

    tips:
        -- puts and gets several times using different variables 
            -- collect the year, make, model, color, price... anything you think is important about a car
        --at the end, display the final puts in any order that makes sense to you
