step 1:
    puts "hello world"

step 2:
    puts static welcome --customize
    input = gets -- capture data into variable
    puts input -- puts variable instead of hard coded string

Challenge: 
    Objective: create a basic intake form for a car, after collecting the data display it in a single puts statment in a sensible way

    tips:
        -- puts and gets several times using different variables 
            -- collect the year, make, model, color, price... anything you think is important about a car
        --at the end, display the final puts in any order that makes sense to you
