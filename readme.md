step 1:
   Make a menu using conditionals, as a bonus write tests for all our work so far and test the new conditionals we write today

Challenge: 
    Context: We are making a simple Car Inventory System for a small used car dealer. Our first request is to add a simple way to add new inventory into the system as it comes in.

    Objective: Write a menu class that we can make a useable program that doesn't require coding knowledge to operate and gives us the ability to let the user decide on more things to do in the program

    tips:
        getting close to a fully functional application!
