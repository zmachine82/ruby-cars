step 1:
  We have a minimal viable product, you have a usable UI to add, list, and sell cars!
  What other fun things can we add to our App?

Challenge: 
    Context: We are making a simple Car Inventory System for a small used car dealer. Basic functionality is done, we are in bonus feature territory!

    Objective: Add something useful to the app, talk to me about ideas!
