step 1:
   Symbols are a ruby thing to help with naming things, used in attributes for example
   Structs and hashes are alternative ways to handle data instead of arrays or class attributes... Structs and hashes are almost the same thing in alot of ways, a struct is a simple hash
Challenge: 
    Context: We are making a simple Car Inventory System for a small used car dealer. Our first request is to add a simple way to add new inventory into the system as it comes in.

    Objective: Lets add the ability to sell a car to the menu. When we choose that option, that will use a struct or hash to calculate fees and taxes on to the value to give the final sale price, with an option to say yes or no to completing the sale

    tips:
        getting close to a fully functional application! 
        arrays are accessed by an index, wheras hashes and structs are accessed by a name of some sort
