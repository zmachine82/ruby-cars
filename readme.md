step 1:
   separate classes out to source files and leave the first file to handle importing and newing up those objects.. so a runner file and a couple separate files for classes and a new Module

Challenge: 
    Context: We are making a simple Car Inventory System for a small used car dealer. Our first request is to add a simple way to add new inventory into the system as it comes in.

    Objective: Obviously things are getting cluttered and kind of complex. Lets separate out the classes to files and find homes for every piece of code... Also lets add in some kind of module to help us organize shared code or to kick off our app
